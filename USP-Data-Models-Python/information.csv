Each instance is associated with an interface capable of transporting Ethernet-encapsulated packets, and contains a set of unidirectional Ethernet statistics.
The statistics are sampled either on ingress or on egress. This is determined as follows:
If the instance is associated with an egress queue (or queues) via the Queue parameter or by setting AllQueues to true then data is sampled on egress. In this case Bytes etc measure the data that has been sent on the interface, possibly filtered by Queue or VLANID.
Otherwise data is sampled on ingress. In this case Bytes etc measure the data that has been received on the interface, possibly filtered by VLANID.
When sampling on egress, the term received means received by the queuing sub-system.
Multiple instances can be associated with a single interface: individual instances can be configured to collect data associated with the entire interface, or with a particular VLAN and/or queue.
The CPE MUST reset each instances’s Stats parameters whenever the instance is disabled and re-enabled. Whether this reset occurs when the instance becomes operationally disabled (Status = Disabled) or administratively enabled (Enable = true) is a local matter to the CPE. This is similar to the behavior of interface statistics, e.g. as specified for Device.Ethernet.Interface.{i}.Stats. Furthermore, this instance’s Stats parameters MUST be reset whenever the referenced interface’s Stats parameters are reset, or when the referenced queue or VLAN is disabled and re-enabled.
For enabled table entries, if Interface references an interface that is not capable of transporting Ethernet-encapsulated packets, or if Queue references a queue that is not instantiated on Interface, or if Queue is not a valid reference and AllQueues is false, the table entry is inoperable and the CPE MUST set Status to Error_Misconfigured.
Note: The Device.Ethernet.RMONStats.{i}. table includes unique key parameters that are strong references. If a strongly referenced object is deleted, the CPE will set the referencing parameter to an empty string. However, doing so under these circumstances might cause the updated Device.Ethernet.RMONStats.{i}. row to then violate the table’s unique key constraint; if this occurs, the CPE MUST set Status to Error_Misconfigured and disable the offending Device.Ethernet.RMONStats.{i}. row.
At most one entry in this table can exist with a given value for Alias, or with the same values for all of Interface, VLANID and Queue.

"Device.IP.Interface.{i}.","object(0:)","W","IP interface table (a stackable interface object as described in [Section 4.2/TR-181i2]). This table models the layer 3 IP interface.
Each IP interface can be attached to the IPv4 and/or IPv6 stack. The interface’s IP addresses and prefixes are listed in the IPv4Address, IPv6Address and IPv6Prefix tables.
Note that support for manipulating Loopback interfaces is OPTIONAL, so the implementation MAY choose not to create (or allow the Controller to create) Device.IP.Interface.{i}. instances of type Loopback.
When the Controller administratively disables the interface, i.e. sets Enable to false, the interface’s automatically-assigned IP addresses and prefixes MAY be retained. When the Controller administratively enables the interface, i.e. sets Enable to true, these IP addresses and prefixes MUST be refreshed. It’s up to the implementation to decide exactly what this means: it SHOULD take all reasonable steps to refresh everything but if it is unable, for example, to refresh a prefix that still has a significant lifetime, it might well choose to retain rather than discard it.
Any Tunneled IP interface instances instantiated by the CPE MUST NOT have any statistics, writable parameters, IP addresses or IPv6 prefixes. Any read-only parameters, e.g. Status, MUST return the same information as for the corresponding Tunnel interface. The reason for these rules is that Tunneled IP interfaces exist only in order to be the targets of references (within the data model) and do not model any concepts over and above those already modeled by the Tunnel IP interfaces.
Note that Tunnel and Tunneled IP interfaces are part of a legacy mechanism that is only used for IPv6rd, DSLite and IPsec tunnels and MUST NOT be used in any other context. For all other tunneling mechanisms Normal IP interfaces are stacked above technology-specific Tunnel Interfaces, e.g. above GRE.Tunnel.{i}.Interface or MAP.Domain.{i}.Interface objects.
